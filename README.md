## Introduction

For the mock servers available, it becomes very difficult to keep a track of all the stubs and respective matchers/predicates. Idea behind mockview is to build a view that lists all stubs from your mocksever.
Disclaimer: This is also a pet project to learn react.

### Features (work in progress)

- List all stubs from running mountebank or wiremock mock server
- Capability to view information for a stub as in matchers/predicates and responses
- Capability to search from a list of stubs
- Capability to sort stubs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
